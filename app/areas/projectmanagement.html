    <h4>Consultancy</h4>
    <p>The world of IT has always been fast paced. Recently it has really gathered some momentum and it is 
    tough for a business owner to keep up with all the new technology and software. We know that all 
    you want to do is get on with your core business and that you need a robust and reliable IT system 
    to support you.</p>
    <p>With the vast range of modern tech and the rate at which each item is brought to market, it is easy 
    to see how you may have missed the release of a new IT development that could really save you 
    money and/or boost your revenues. Similarly, a well marketed development may have made big 
    claims for itself and has perhaps tempted you to make a sizable investment when there are actually 
    better options for your business out there.</p>
    <p>A consultation with us will allow you to consider all the benefits of revolutionising your companyâ€™s 
    IT. We will study your business needs and assess your current set up. We will work with you to 
    create a vision for your IT that optimises your investment and we will agree a roadmap of 
    implementation, be it phased or otherwise.</p>
    <p>At Complus IT Ltd we boast extensive experience in Project Management and Consultancy, grounded 
    and underpinned with sound economics and business management; a very potent combination
