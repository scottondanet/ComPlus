    <h4>Office 365 and Hosted Services</h4>
    <p>In any market there is always one product that stands out. One product that leads the way leaving others to imitate and play catch up. As you might expect, when it comes to a premium product you often have to pay a premium price to get your hands on it… but not always. </p>
    <p>When it comes to office software for your business, there is really only one viable option and it has been the software of choice for a number of years for the majority of companies worldwide. Microsoft Office has never been surpassed and for good reason. Even the high initial purchase cost and requirement to upgrade every few years was not enough to put businesses off. The expenditure was seen as more than worth it, even for companies requiring the software on numerous computers.</p>
    <p>Recently, Microsoft Office 365 has really taken off. Businesses are migrating their office IT software to 356 to instantly enjoy the advantages of market-leading programmes like, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, Access and Publisher. </p>
    <p>The scramble to go 365 is partly due to it being much more cost effective. There is no initial outlay and no recurring cost down the line in the form of upgrades. Office 365 is adaptable too. As your company grows and takes on more staff, you simply add them to your subscription and they’re up and running.</p>
    <p>The ability to securely access your files anywhere and from any device is one of its most attractive features as it boosts productivity and communication. Office 365 is usable on Android, Apple and of course Windows devices (phones, tablets, laptops and desktops).</p>
