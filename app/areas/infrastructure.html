    <h4>Cable Structure</h4>
    <p>The structure of cables is frequently the overlooked element in the equation of the perfect IT formula. Often a poor structure, possibly built up over time in an ad hoc fashion, is the main reason why companies experience bad connections and a slow performance.</p>
    <p>A cable structure is a complicated thing. There are many different types of cable and they are all intended for different tasks and at different capacities. Imagine a road network that has London connected to Manchester with a single A road, but has sleepy Tonbridge connected to nearby Tunbridge Wells with a looping seventy-mile six-lane motorway. We have seen the equivalent of this in the cable infrastructure of many companies.</p>
    <p>At COMPLUS IT LTD, we have the experience and expertise to structure your cables correctly. We meticulously research your set up and calculate the correct topology for your business. This is a bespoke service which ensures that your infrastructure is implemented to give you maximum efficiency.</p>
    <p>We pride ourselves on the thorough testing of the structures that we put in place. Unlike some competitors, we use highest specification of testing and reporting apparatus. This sophisticated process guarantees that once your cables are in place, they function at full capacity. We never sign off an installation without this vigorous testing procedure. This allows us to boast that we have never been called back to put something right; it is always right before we leave.</p>
