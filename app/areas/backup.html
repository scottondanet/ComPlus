    <h4>Backup & Disaster Recovery</h4>
<p>With the ever increasing importance of data to modern businesses, a backup strategy is essential. If
files get lost and you can’t recover them, there is no telling what the effect could be. Imagine you 
are about to invoice a client for all the goods and services you have provided to them and BAM! No data!</p>
<p>Your server gives up and your computer screens are blank. You don’t know if this client owes you 
thousands or tens of thousands. This nightmare has been faced by many business owners since 
computerisation, but it is something that can be avoided.</p>
<p>A good Backup strategy should include practices and processes that staff adhere to regularly and 
include a Disaster Recovery Plan. This is something that can be put in place should the worst happen. 
Being prepared for the worst means that you can limit your loss of revenue from any down time, 
ensure that no invoices are missed and that you keep that excellent reputation that you have 
worked hard for.</p>
<p>Backup strategies are not really an off-the-shelf product. Your business is unique and the way you 
treat and use data is different to others. We always recommend a tailored plan, customised and 
optimised for maximum benefit to your business. </p>
